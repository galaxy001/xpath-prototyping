Adds the input field for XPath to the bottom of each page.
Beware: weekend project.

Usage:
Hold Alt key and mouse click on something on the page to generate XPath.
XPath is the same as generated by FireBug: `id` and `class` attributes are not used, `[1]` conditions are omitted.
You can modify XPath and watch the selection immediately being colored in pale yellow color.
Press `JSON` button to show prompt with JSON, containing innerHTML of selected elements.
